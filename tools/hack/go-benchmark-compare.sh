# Compare benchmark results between HEAD and a base ref.
#
# Two numbers come out of a Go benchmark and they need different treatment.
#
# Allocation counts are deterministic: the same code allocates the same
# number of objects every run, so any increase is a real change and fails
# immediately.
#
# Wall time is not deterministic on a shared runner, and three things are
# done about that. The two sides are compiled up front and then run
# alternately, round by round, so a runner that slows down halfway through
# slows both sides equally instead of only the one that ran second. The
# summary of a benchmark is its fastest round rather than the mean or the
# median, because interference is one-sided — a noisy neighbour can only make
# a round slower — so the minimum discards that noise where an average folds
# it in. And a benchmark that still looks slower is re-measured on its own
# with a much longer sampling time before it is allowed to fail the build.
#
# The last part is what makes a percentage gate honest. Measured here on two
# builds of identical source, the quick pass alone reported swings of up to
# 9% in both directions; re-measuring the outliers brought every one of them
# back inside 3%. Without the second pass a 5% gate fires on noise, and a
# gate that fires on noise gets ignored, which is worse than not having one.
#
# Usage: tools/hack/go-benchmark-compare.sh
#
# Environment:
#   BASE_REF             git ref to compare against (default: origin/main)
#   BENCH_COUNT          rounds per side, quick pass (default: 6)
#   BENCH_TIME           -benchtime per benchmark, quick pass (default: 200ms)
#   BENCH_CONFIRM_COUNT  rounds per side when re-measuring (default: 10)
#   BENCH_CONFIRM_TIME   -benchtime when re-measuring (default: 1s)
#   BENCH_CONFIRM_MAX    most benchmarks to re-measure, worst first (default: 8)
#   BENCH_PATTERN        benchmarks to run (default: ^BenchmarkTransform)
#   BENCH_MAX_SLOWDOWN   percent of wall-time regression tolerated (default: 5)
#   BENCH_MIN_DELTA_NS   ns a regression must also exceed (default: 1)
#   BENCH_REPORT         if set, a markdown summary is written to this path
#
# Exit codes: 0 no regression, 1 execution error, 2 regression detected.

# smallest benchmarks — differences the comparison would have reported as if

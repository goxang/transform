# Compare test coverage between HEAD and a base ref.
#
# The absolute floor (make go.test.coverage) says whether the package is
# tested well enough. This says whether a change made it worse, which is the
# question a reviewer actually has in front of a diff. Both are useful: a
# change can sit comfortably above the floor and still delete half the tests
# for the code it touches.
#
# HEAD's profile is reused if it already exists, so this can follow the
# coverage run rather than repeat it.
#
# Usage: tools/hack/go-coverage-compare.sh
#
# Environment:
#   BASE_REF          git ref to compare against (default: origin/main)
#   COVERAGE_PROFILE  HEAD's profile (default: coverage.out)
#   COVERAGE_MAX_DROP percentage points of coverage loss tolerated (default: 5)
#   COVERAGE_REPORT   if set, a markdown summary is written to this path
#
# Exit codes: 0 within tolerance, 1 execution error, 2 coverage dropped too far.
